# chat-app-socketio


The target was to understand how soket is working and what are concept.
In this I have build two main pages, one is for create a chat room and one is for joining chat room.
While creating chat room it will generate one random code and by using that you can join in chat room.
All the people can talk with each other in perticular room and can leave room.
Use session concept as well, so that no one can directly enter into chat-room.

Here I have used falsk for backend server side code, and html,css,js for front end part.
